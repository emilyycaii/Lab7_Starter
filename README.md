## Questions
1. I would fit my automated tests within a GitHub Action that runs whenever code is pushed. It would ensure that any new code changes are tested, help catch bugs early, and keep the codebase stable during its development process.

2. No, you would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output because end to end testing is meant to be used to test the full flow of an application, not just one functions.

3. The difference between navigation and snapshot mode is that navigation mode analyzes a page after it loads while snapshot mode analyzes a page in its current state.

4. Based on the Lighthouse results, to improve the site, one thing we can do is to add a <meta name="viewport"> tag. Another thing we can do is to fix the sizing of the images. One more thing we can do is to serve images in next-gen format.
